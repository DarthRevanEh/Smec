Smec

Welcome to Smec! 
This is a game where you disrespect your friends, hit sweet combos, and all around kick some tail.

To install the game, simply download the "Resources and Executables" folder from Google Drive, or 
pull the "Smec" repository from GitHub.

Next, if your monitor resolution is 1280x1024, run the executable entitled "Smec(1280x1024)" in the 
"Resources and Executables" folder. Otherwises, run the executable entitled "Smec(OtherResolutions)". 
(These seperate executables are due to limitations with the Turing environment).
Once the game opens, select the characters for players one and two. 

You need two players to play this game.


The object of the game is to knock your opponent offscreen, similar to Nintendo's "Super Smash Bros."

Every time you are hit, your damage percent increases. The higher your damage percent, the further 
you will go flying when hit, and the longer you will be unable to move.

If you go too far offscreen in any direction, you will die. 
You have five lives. Run out of lives, and it’s over.


Each player's controls are as follows:

right_key	| d		| RIGHT_ARROW
		|		|
attack_key	| g		| 0 (on number pad)
