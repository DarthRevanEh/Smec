Welcome the the advanced tutorial!
Make sure you read README.txt first!

This tutorial will teach you how to win!
Let's dive right in:

When moving on the ground, pressing left or right will make you move instantly. 
However, when in the air, you have velocity, meaning if you stop pressing left or right, 
you will continue moving through the air. Use this to approach your opponent while attacking.

You have two jumps, one off the ground and one in the air. Falling off the stage without jumping
will leave you with only your aerial jump. You will regain your jumps when you land back on the stage,
but you will not get your aerial jump back if you are hit in the air.
Trying to hit your opponent in the air when they do not have any jumps left is a great way of killing them early.
Pressing left or right while you jump will make you jump with the maximum left or right velocity.
It will also change your direction (which way you are facing). Use this to outmaneuver your opponent in the air!

Pressing down while in the air will make you fall more quickly. Use this to attack grounded opponents from above,
or to fall quickly after an aerial attack.

Every move has its own unique knockback, hitstun (amount of time the opponent will be unable to move after being hit) 
and trajectory (some moves have more vertical knockback, others horizontal).

Every time you are hit, your damage percent increases. The higher your damage percent, 
the further you will go flying when hit, and the longer you will be in hitstun.

If you are hit closer to the center of your player, your damage percent will 
increase more than if you are hit near the edges of your player.


There are three characters to choose from, each with their own gameplay styles.


1. Wu

A sensei from somewhere in Asia. A very balanced fighter, with a mild combo game 
and some powerful kill moves. Easy to learn, but tough to master.

Setup moves:
Up air
Neutral air
Down air

Kill moves:
Ground hit
Forward air
Back air
Down air
Up air

Useful combos:
Neutral air -> Forward air
Down air -> Ground hit
Up air -> Up air (off the top)

Special ability: Zen
As Wu becomes more damaged, he also becomes more focused: If Wu is at high damage percent, he will deal extra knockback to 
enemies, even if they are not at a high damage percent. Using this, Wu can score some incredibly quick kills!


2. Dante

Dante's the name, combo's the game. Dante is a fast fighter who excels at long combos. Not easy
to play, but if played correctly, can be an unbeatable force.

Setup moves:
Ground hit
Up air
Neutral air
Down air

Kill moves:
Forward air
Back air
Down air

Useful combos:
Ground hit -> Back air
The Pillar: Ground hit -> Down air -> Ground hit (repeat)
The Dante Special : Ground hit -> Up air -> Forward air

Special ability: Float
When in the air, Dante will fall more slowly than other fighters,
thanks to his cape. Use this to hover near the edge and forward air a 
recovering enemy, or to get back to the stage after a long offstage combo. 


3. Astro 

If you like cyborg killing machines, Astro is for you. With a gun as a hand,
Astro punches, kicks and shoots his way to victory. Astro has incredible range and
knockback, but very little hitstun. If your opponent isn't fast, they will find themselves
dying before they even land a hit. Yes, Astro is the jerk who brought a gun to a fist fight.

Setup moves:
Up air
Down air

Kill moves:
Everything

Useful combos:
Ground hit -> Forward air
Down air -> Ground hit

Special ability: Range
Most of Astro's moves have hitboxes outside of Astro's hitbox,
meaning you can easily hit the enemies without being hit in return.
Use this to your advantage and space yourself correctly,
and you will be untouchable.
