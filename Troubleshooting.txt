Known glitches:

1.
Sometimes, after atacking, your hitbox will stay active forever.
If you use your ground attack when this happens, you will be stuck, unable to move, until you are hit.
Getting hit seems to sometimes fix the glitch, but not all the time.

2.
Sometimes, when using your up-air attack, you will be stuck in that pose, unable to jump,
until you hit the ground. Landing seems to end this glitch, but nevertheless you 
can lose a combo because of this.
